Computer Vision + ML = Pain
Is able to use camera feed to track a white piece of paper and read the number that is written on it. The NeuralNetwork.py file constructs the architecture for a FNN without any external ML libraries, such as PyTorch or Keras. However, after I wrapped that section up, I decided to move on and see if I can find similar success with PyTorch.
